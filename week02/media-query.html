            <h2>2 Nephi 9:6</h2>
            <p>
                For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfil the merciful plan of the great Creator, there must needs be a power of
                resurrection, and the resurrection must needs come unto man by reason of the fall; and the fall came by reason of
                transgression; and because man became fallen they were cut off from the presence of the Lord.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wherefore, it must needs be an infinite atonementâ€”save it should be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put
                on incorruption. Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man must needs have remained to an endless duration. And
                if so, this flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more.
