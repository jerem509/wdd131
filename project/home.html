                    J√©r√©mie, known as the "City of Poets," is a charming coastal town in southwestern Haiti‚Äôs Grand'Anse department, founded
                    in 1756 (Encyclopaedia Britannica). Nestled between lush mountains and the Caribbean Sea, it has a population of around
                    134,000 (World Population Review). Despite its relative isolation, J√©r√©mie has a rich cultural heritage, especially in
                    literature and the arts, earning its poetic nickname for producing many renowned Haitian writers and poets (Haiti
                    Cultural Exchange).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city is famously the birthplace of General Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, a Creole hero who fought under Napoleon and
                    fathered the celebrated French author Alexandre Dumas (BBC History, Encyclopedia.com). This connection highlights
                    J√©r√©mie‚Äôs deep historical roots and global significance.

                    Throughout its history, J√©r√©mie has faced major challenges, including severe damage from Hurricane Hazel in 1954 and
                    Hurricane Matthew in 2016 (NOAA, UN OCHA). In 1964, the city endured the tragic J√©r√©mie Vespers massacre, a dark chapter
                    in its political history (Human Rights Watch). After the devastating 2010 earthquake, J√©r√©mie‚Äôs airport became a vital
                    hub for humanitarian aid (UN Relief Web, IFRC).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, J√©r√©mie remains a vibrant cultural center known for its colonial architecture, lively markets, and stunning
                    beaches like Grand-Anse (Lonely Planet). The local cuisine, featuring dishes such as griot and pikliz, reflects the
                    region‚Äôs rich traditions (Haiti Tourism Board).
